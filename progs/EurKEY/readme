This is a closed-source program for generating extra characters on US layout (eg öäüõ)
Including win & linux copy as it's only available from https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/
and not sure whether mirrors exist

Note 2024: there are alternatives, e.g. keyd

Current version is 1.3 beta (added 21.04.23)

# Installation

## Win

  1.  Uncompress the zip file onto your desktop. This will create a new folder named eurkey.
  1.  Open the folder and execute setup.exe
  1.  Choose the new keyboard layout by clicking on Start - Control Panel - Regional and Language Options
      Alternatively, run RunDll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL intl.cpl,,2
  1.  Relogin. In case you have already used an older version of EurKEY restart the computer.

## Linux

best to use the deb. there's also xmodmap config, but as the project itself stated:
  > This is a very old version of EurKEY and will probably not work on your linux
  > installation, but may help you creating your own Xmodmap definition. Use this only
  > if you know what this is all about.

note a copy of said xmodmap file is backed up here in same directory. also node xmodmap
usage and .deb version/installation should be, as i understand, mutually exclusive.
